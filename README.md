# Advent of Code 2024

My attempt on [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) using Rust language which I learn as I go along.

# to run

```bash
cargo run {day} 
```
where {day} is a number from 1 to 25 e.g:

```bash
cargo run 1
```
to run day 1

alternatively build and run the docker image for day 1:

```bash
docker build -t advent-of-code-2024 .
docker run -it advent-of-code-2024 1
```

Starting from day 10 I've switched to Python. I've kept this readme file for the Rust version for now.
